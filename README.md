# SETiNS
Cloud computing and Cloud data storage have become the preferred method for delivering services over a network. As the data in today's scenario is proliferative, there is a need to keep it safer which requires organizations to integrate their data usage and management patterns. To meet these requirements, No-SQL due to its better scalability, is a vantage over RDBMS. 

A prototype implementation of storage efficiency for No-SQL database (SETiNS) in which deduplication and compression together are used to avoid unnecessary storage purchases and reduce storage space for unraveling large volumes of data handling problems. The improved storage efficiency for No-SQL database is requires the combination of the MapReduce capabilities of Hadoop with the schema-less database MongoDB.
